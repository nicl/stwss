Many of these sites have simple and clear navigation, bold images
(particularly on the homepage), and 'younger' designs.

HTB has a navigation aggressively targeting new people (first nav item
is 'I'm New', also Alpha).

All are full of vibrant photography! A great way of conveying spirit.

Soul Survivor is great but perhaps a bit too busy. The primary
navigation is slightly harder to focus on/decipher.

Christchurch Balham is a stock design - shows that a template site can
work well if your budget is limited.

Many of these sites have simple and clear navigation, bold images
(particularly on the homepage), and 'younger' designs.

HTB has a navigation aggressively targeting new people (first nav item
is 'I'm New', also Alpha).

All are full of vibrant photography! A great way of conveying spirit.

Soul Survivor is great but perhaps a bit too busy. The primary
navigation is slightly harder to focus on/decipher.

Christchurch Balham is a stock design - shows that a template site can
work well if your budget is limited.

## Christchurch London

[https://christchurchlondon.org](https://christchurchlondon.org)

An initially clean design, with clear nav and good imagery, but
compromised by a fixed-height design, confusing navigation, and poor
typography.

### +ves

* big nav
* big image on homepage
* images of the city
* clean top-part of design

### -ves

* very little actual info on homepage
* services page presents info as para, not clear bullets/list
* weird scrolling (as determination to fix page to screen height)
* confusing main nav ('visit' (services), 'more', 'explore', etc.)
* poor typography (too small)
* links not clearly delineated (e.g. on homepage slideshow)

## Christchurch Balham

[http://www.christchurchbalham.org.uk/](http://www.christchurchbalham.org.uk/)

Overall a successful design. Navigation could be improved though. And
the site does a poor job of targeting newcomers. Having said that,
it's pretty easy to get a sense of what the church is about. Some of
the standard nav headings help here ('who we are', 'what we do').

### +ves

* big nav
* big image/slides on homepage
* clean message about who they are and what they offer on homepage
* nice design
* contact form in footer
* news and sermons in footer (so every page)
* 'New to Christianity' section (though hard to find)

### -ves

* horizontal image is weird height on non-homepages
* secondary nav hard to spot (e.g. /what-we-do/on-sundays)
* service information hard to find (under /what-we-do)
* poor imagery and positioning *within* articles
  (e.g. new-here/new-to-ccb)
* poorly targeted at newcomers ('get involved' sounds like it's meant
  for existing members)

## St Michael's Bristol

[http://www.stmichaelsbristol.org/](http://www.stmichaelsbristol.org/)

First impression is very cluttered, and a bit clunky. Ultimately, the
nav (both primary and secondary) is overwhelming and I can't get past
it.

### +ves

* strong leading image

### -ves

* cluttered nav
* secondary nav is blocky
* way too much nav!
*

## HTB

[http://www.htb.org/](http://www.htb.org/)

A beautiful site, with great imagery and user-journeys targeted at
specific needs (new users, members, and shopping).

### +ves

* great design (clearly professional)
* loads of great images (especially on homepage)
* good targeting of new people ('I'm New' nav element)
* 'quick links' in footer
* mega nav for I'm New and other stuff
* personalised welcome from Nicky and Pippa Gumbel with great photo
  and signature (/about-htb)
* very clear journey for new users (I'm New -> /about-htb -> leaders,
  about, services, alpha, connect groups,

### -ves

* slow to load

## HTC

[http://holytrinityclapham.org/](http://holytrinityclapham.org/)

A good example of a template site that works reasonably well without
being difficult to set up.

### +ves

* 'Sundays' in nav is clear and useful
* slideshow on homepage is useful and dynamic

### -ves

* primary nav overflows onto second line
* logo looks washed out/could be bolder
* design is a bit faded and not so clear
* redundant links (e.g. /sundays/mornings linked from /sundays which
  already contains all the info)

## iSource

## Bethel Redding

## Hope

[http://hopeculture.tv/](http://hopeculture.tv/)

Nice example of a Bootstrap site that is simple, visually attractive,
and well targeted.

### +ves

* bootstrap so quickly designed
* strong banner and imagery
* like HTB, well targeted at new people
* big google map on homepage displays location easily and service time
* interested in serving page with a form

### -ves

* .tv domain is weird
* Give immediately redirects to payment site, rather than a nice
  landing page onsite

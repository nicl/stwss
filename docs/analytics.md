Analytics
=========

Tracking was added on the 21st Feb, 2015. So about a month's worth of
data at the time of writing. Over this period we've had:

    2,027 page views
    1,646 unique page views (repeated visits by the same user not counted)
    49s average dwell time
    64.08% bounce rate
    41.88% exit rate
    2/3 users are new

Most visits are from organic search (Google - 47%). Unfortunately,
keywords are not provided for most (90%) of these searches. Many,
however, have visited the site before - suggesting some of these
visits are simply people who have forgotten the site URL.

`/children-youth` is 404ing. Suggesting a broken link somewhere or in
search engines (definitely the last). But then, are people searching
for this? If so, should we optimise for this more?

Some initial conclusions:

* a surprising number of people visit the site given the complete lack
  of promotion
* search is vital in driving traffic
* most people only see the homepage (either because they find the
  information they need, or more likely, decide they are not
  interested)
* the majority of visitors are new, suggesting they are people looking
  for a church/new to the area - we'll need better analytics to
  confirm this though
* bizarrely, bounce rates for returning and new visitors are roughly
  the same (~64%)

Some outstanding hypotheses:

* most visitors are people searching for a new church, most likely
  because they have recently moved into the area (need better keyword
  data to verify this)
* other visitors might be families looking for children/youth stuff

If true, we should optimise for this group.

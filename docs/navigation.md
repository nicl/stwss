==========

Top-level nav for the current site:

* Home
* About STwSS
* Services
* Other church activities
* Children + Youth
* Community
* Contact Us

Contrast with HTB:

* I'm New / Connect / Media / Try Alpha

HTB makes *calls to action* - it doesn't simply present information.

Or with Christchurch Balham:

* Who we are / What we do / Our talks / Get involved / Find us

A bit more standard, but still, snappier and clearer than headings
like 'Other church activies'.

## The new nav

* consolidated

Children + Youth, Community, and Other Church Activities can be
grouped together.

Contact Us is probably not primary nav material.

Home can be a logo/icon, no need for main nav item.

Likewise, 'Contact Us' is too vague - HTB gets this right (the call to
action should be targeted at a particular need/user).
